## About the Project
This study examines the privacy and security features of Android applications designed for marginalized communities, including individuals with disabilities. By analyzing 15 popular apps, we identify security flaws, third-party trackers, and unsafe data handling practices. The goal is to assess compliance with regulations and ensure data protection for vulnerable populations.**dynamic analysis** to monitor runtime behavior.  
Our objectives include:
- Identifying potential vulnerabilities and issues.
- Gaining hands-on experience with software analysis tools.
